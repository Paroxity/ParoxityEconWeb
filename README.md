# ParoxityEcon Web Panel

A web interface for interacting with ParoxityEcon, a plugin for PocketMine-MP servers providing support for multiple currencies. <br />
**This currently only supports MySQL based database**.

## How to use?

1) Before proceeding any further, make sure that you have run the [ParoxityEcon](https://github.com/Paroxity/ParoxityEcon) plugin atleast once.
2) Next you have two choices, either you can host the panel yourself or use the panel directly by heading over to [econ.paroxity.net](https://econ.paroxity.net).
3) Whichever method you choose to proceed with, you will then click the **Connect** button on the main page of the panel.
4) Enter the credentials to your MySQL database.
5) Upon successful connection, you will be redirected to **Currency** page, where you could add, edit and delete the currencies as you so desire.
6) Simple.. Wasn't it?

## Self Hosting

**We assume that you are aware on how to setup a web server yourself and so we will not be getting into the great details on how to do that.**

1) We don't recommend self-hosting unless you know what you are doing.
2) Clone or download this repository from [here](https://github.com/Paroxity/paroxity-econ-web/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
3) Extract the downloaded repository to the folder where you want to serve the site.
4) Connect to the website via the IP address of your web server.
5) And voila! Enjoy..
